Add an EPC graph generator to the EPCs section of a property record

== Description ==

Add an EPC graph generator to the EPCs section of a property record

== Installation ==

= Manual installation =

The manual installation method involves downloading the Property Hive EPC Graph Generator Add-on plugin and uploading it to your webserver via your favourite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains [instructions on how to do this here](http://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation).

Once installed and activated, you can access the EPC graph generator by navigating to the 'Property EPCs' section of a property record under the 'Media' tab
