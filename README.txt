Add an EPC graph generator to the EPCs section of a property record

== Description ==

Add an EPC graph generator to the EPCs section of a property record

== Installation ==

= Manual installation =

The manual installation method involves downloading the Property Hive EPC Graph Generator Add-on plugin and uploading it to your webserver via your favourite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains [instructions on how to do this here](http://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation).

Once installed and activated, you can access the EPC graph generator by navigating to the 'Property EPCs' section of a property record under the 'Media' tab

= Updating =

Updating should work like a charm; as always though, ensure you backup your site just in case.

* Renamed ajax_object to something more explicit to prevent it conflicting with other plugins
* Prevented undefined error on admin pages that don't have a $post object set
